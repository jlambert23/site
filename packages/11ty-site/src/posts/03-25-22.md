Jesus this has been annoying.
Currently dealing with it not picking up any of my files.
Meaninmg there is a bug somewhere and it's not reporting it. Awesome.

I'm spending way more time fucking with 11ty than I am building my site.
WHich is the fucking reason I picked 11ty in the first place.

I wanted component-like building and hierarchy in minimal html/css/js.
I didn't want a framework.
Somehow it feels like I got one.

Not to mention the docs are awful.

okay cool now i have to figure out how to render a fucking js file
because the typing and erasing effect will be more effective with js
jesus fucking christ why am i not just using react
## -- end rant

I figured it out using `renderFile`...
Which I had to relearn how to use but at least it didn't take nearly as long as the
first time, when I was messing with markdown.

Now to try this asshole out: https://usefulangle.com/post/75/typing-effect-animation-javascript-css
